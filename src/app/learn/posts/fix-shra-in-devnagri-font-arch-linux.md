title: Fix "shra" in Devnagri font in Arch Linux
description: I noticed that "shra" as you can see in thumbnail is not correctly rendered in the arch linux when tried to look up my own name in devnagri script so tried different ways to resolve this issue and the reason of the problem was really dumb.

So I have previously tried Arch Linux. But it never occured to me that its default devnagri font does not have shra in it. So then I tried to fix it. Went to several forums and some blogs and here is how you can actually fix the issue without any problem

Solution - just delete gnu-free-fonts from your system and all good.
